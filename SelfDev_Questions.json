    "question": "Do you prefer your project to flow like a calm river or rush like a wave?",
    "info": "This question is a poetic way to explore your project management style. A calm river can symbolize a preference for a steady, predictable, and consistent pace. A wave suggests a desire for an intense, fast-paced, and high-energy approach. What do you honestly prefer? Mention at least two reasons. Do you feel more comfortable with a project that flows at a steady pace, or do you get more energized by a project that moves quickly and intensely? Your truthful response will reveal your ideal work rhythm.",
